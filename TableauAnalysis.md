For this project I compared the peak hours of the 2022 summer months to the 2022-2023 winter months. In addition, I calculated the top 10 and bottom 10 bike stations in New York. You can also see a map of all CitiBike stations in New York City. 

With the map, there are many stations grouped together in Manhattan, particularly south of Central Park. As you get to the outer boroughs, the number of stations decreases, with Staten Island having no stations whatsoever. 

The peak hours in all summer months occurred at 6:00 PM (or 1800 hours), with a smaller peak at 8:00 AM. The peak hours in all winter months occurred at 5:00 PM (or 1700 hours), with again a smaller peak at 8:00 AM. Additionally, the number of rides in the summer were much larger compared to the number of rides in winter. This is most likely because the weather is nicer during the summer, so more people are likely to ride bikes. The peak hours occur an hour later in the summer than in winter, as summer daylight is much longer than daylight in the winter. 

The top 10 stations are all in Manhattan, with all but one south of Central Park. The lone station not south of Central Park is located on the Upper East Side. The bottom 10 stations are less concentrated, but eight of them are located outside of Manhattan.
